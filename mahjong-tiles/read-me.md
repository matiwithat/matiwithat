these tile textures are not mine! i host them to use them on other websites, which i think is okay (the page says you can use it in your personal projects).

you can download the original file (which contains different orientations of the tiles, tenbo, and more) here: [gamblemountain's riichi mahjong assets on itch.io](https://gamblemountain.itch.io/riichi-asset)
